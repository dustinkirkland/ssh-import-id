.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility will securely contact a public keyserver and retrieve one or more user's public keys, and append these to the current user's \fI~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fP file, standard output or any other specified output file.

User IDs can be prepended by a protocol:

 - \fBlp:\fP to use \fIhttps://launchpad.net/~%s/+sshkeys\fP
 - \fBgh:\fP to use \fIhttps://api.github.com/users/%s/keys\fP
 - \fBgl:\fP to use \fIhttps://gitlab.com/%s.keys\fP

If the protocol is not explicitly specified, then \fBssh-import-id\fP will read a URL variable string from \fI/etc/ssh/ssh_import_id\fP as installed by your package manager and configured by your system administrator.  You can override this locally by exporting the string you want in a URL environment variable.  If all of these are empty, then the protocol is assumed to be "lp:", which was the original target implementation of this tool.

Any keys added will be "labled" with a trailing comment, "# ssh-import-id PROTO:USER_ID".  Revoking keys will first look for lines in the authorized keys file ending with that label.
